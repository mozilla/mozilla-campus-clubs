## Why Mozilla

At Mozilla, weâ€™re a global **community** of technologists, thinkers and builders **working together** to **keep the Internet alive and accessible**, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web.

Our **mission** is to ensure the Internet is a **global public resource, open and accessible to all**. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

We believe that students are uniquely positioned to make a difference in the world and that by bringing together local groups who care about the internet we can achieve great things.

## Why Mozilla Clubs

A Mozilla Club meets regularly in person to **teach, protect and build** the open web in an engaging and collaborative way.

The Internet is more than computers and code. **The Internet is about people**. And this is what Mozilla Clubs are all about: interacting with others to share, learn, teach, protect and build upon platforms, to make things that matter. Our Clubs are human structures that make the web real.
