    <p>Imagine the highest quality university student programs you’ve ever heard of. Programs that <strong>incite invention, inspire innovation,</strong> and <strong>foster global change</strong>.</p>

    <p>Now imagine a Mozilla program that engaged students all over the world, building campus groups that each have hundreds of passionate volunteers contributing to Mozilla as advocates, technologists, and innovators. Now imagine that these groups were on thousands of University campuses in hundreds of countries.</p>

    <p>That is the vision for Campus Clubs. To spark a movement -- a loud voice, a breeding ground for new ideas, a massive force, a deep talent pool -- that powers the open web to new heights.</p>

    <p>At the start of each year, Campus Clubs plan the impact they want to have for the open web and then hack and build on a combination of recommended activities and their own open source projects to make a difference for the web, their campuses and communities.

## Why Mozilla Clubs

<div class="row">

    <p>A Mozilla Club brings people together locally to build the open web on University and College campuses worldwide.</p>

    <p>The Internet is more than computers and code. The Internet is about people. And this is what Mozilla Clubs are all about: interacting with others to share, learn, teach, protect and build upon platforms, to make things that matter. Our Clubs are human structures that make the web real.</p>

    <p><b>Mozilla Campus Clubs</b> are <b>Mozilla Clubs</b> that take place at a University or College - These clubs take advantage of the unique learning environments of Universities and Colleges to bring students with a passion for technology together to build and innovate on open source projects that build the open web. </p>

## History of Mozilla on Campus

  <div class="col-md-9">
    <p>Long before Mozilla’s first formal student program, “Campus Reps”, opened its doors in 2008,  students have been playing a crucial role in the development of Mozilla and the web itself.</p>

    <p>The student-built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29" target="_blank">Lynx</a> browser was one of the first and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> (Firefox’s distant ancestor!), pioneered by students and staff, opened the graphical web to millions. Many of the original community members who worked on the first firefox in 2002 were students just like you.</p>

    <p>A lot has happened on Campuses since then:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In 2012 the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors" target="_blank">Firefox Student Ambassador Program</a> opened it’s doors to bring together individuals with a passion for Mozilla who wanted to raise awareness about the many benefits of Firefox & other Mozilla products.</li>
      <li>In 2013 the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oko6TzPQE6Y" target="_blank">Maker Party</a> moved students all around the world to come together to teach the web.</li>
      <li>In 2015 the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/2015/Mentors/Clubs" target="_blank">Clubs</a> program started with a mandate to engage people around the world in ongoing web literacy programs.</li>
      <li>In 2015 Mozilla Science started offering <a href="https://science.mozilla.org/blog/introducing-mozilla-science-study-groups" target="_blank">Study Groups</a> for graduate students, researchers, and scientists looking to learn together.</li>
      <li>In 2016 hundreds of students around the world led the <a href="https://takebacktheweb.mozilla.community/2016/07/11/seven-weeks-take-back-web/" target="_blank">Take Back the Web Campaign</a> on their campuses to shift attitudes and change behavior around privacy and security online.</li>
      <li>In late 2016 Campus Clubs was created to carry the work of the Take Back The Web campaign forward but now with an even stronger focus on open source and engaging students in building open web technologies.</li>
    </ul>
