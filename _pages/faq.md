                        <p>Each Club should meet the following:
                            <li><b>Established</b>: For the meantime we want to focus on learning how we can support the groups who are already around. We love that you want to start a new group but we’ll ask that you get started first, then register with Mozilla.</li>
                            <li><b>Hold Regular Meetings:</b> They can be in-person or virtual, but we want to support groups that have a regular cadence of getting together to coordinate, plan, and work.</li>
                            <li><b>Contribute to Mozilla:</b> Obviously! You need to make regular contributions to projects that support Mozilla’s mission, whether it be localizing, coding, answering support questions, throwing events, or participating in campaigns.</li>
                            <li><b>Have at Least 3 Members:</b> Hanging out with a few friends is great but in order to be registered Campus Clubs must have an active set of contributors 3+ members.</li>
                            <li><b>Are Open and Welcoming:</b> Mozilla and it’s official groups welcome everyone who shares Mozilla’s goals and wants to contribute in a healthy and constructive manner to participate. Groups cannot restrict membership.</li>
                            <li><b>Follow the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/">CPG</a>;</b> The heart of Mozilla is people as such we require all groups who participated to agree to adhere and uphold to the Community Participation Guidelines (CPG).</li>
                            If your Club meets the previous criteria, you can apply to register with Mozilla here.

                        Under the resources page you can find a lot and useful guides and tools for how to start a new club in your campus. The Mozilla Campus Clubs is just a network of established clubs that care about Open Source. Other than the availabe resources, we don't provide any further support for starting a new cluv in your campus.

                        No, the Mozilla Campus Clubs program is not shutting down, it will continue to be supported and staffed by the Mozilla Corporation. Local groups with a passion for technology who want to work together to build the open web on university and college campuses are invited to register and participate through the campus clubs program.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Campus Clubs exist on University campuses with a focus on technology and Open Source and engage only students from the campus. Whereas, the Mozilla Clubs existed outside campuses with a focus on reading, writing, and participating on the web.

                        The primary focus of the program is to help students get more skills in an effort of contributing to Open Source projects. It is not an Ambassador program where swag and budget are keys to the program’s success. Instead we offer training and activities which will help students get more skills and work on cutting edge technologies.
                        Budget and swag are not available through the Mozilla Campus Clubs program yet since we are still exploring how Clubs can use them as a tool for advancing our mission in an effort of contributing back to Open Source projects.

                        Part of the definition of a club is that they meet regularly in person. While some activities will definitely be virtual, in order to be recognized as a Mozilla Club they need to be primarily based in the physical world.
