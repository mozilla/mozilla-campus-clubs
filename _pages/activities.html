        <p>You have the entire month of November to create a game loosely based on the theme hacking, modding and/or augmenting.</p>

        <p>What do we mean by loosely based on hacking, modding and/or augmenting? We literally mean, loosely based. Some examples might be:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>an endless runner where you hack down binary trees in your path with a pixelated axe,</li>
          <li>a modern take on a classic e.g. a roguelike set in a 3D or VR world, or</li>
          <li>an augmented reality game bringing octopus/cat hybrids into the real world.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Unleash your creativity. You can work alone or with a team and build for any platform or device.
          The use of open source game engines and libraries is encouraged but not required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keep the web open through open gaming! Game designers and players who embrace open gaming believe that sharing,
          transparency, and rapid prototyping can lead to superior entertainment experiences. Learn more about open gaming here.

        <p>The power of the internet lies in its openness — the web is a level playing field where everyone can create, share, remix, and express themselves</p>
        <p>But in the European Union, the current copyright legal framework undermines this trait. Help keep the web open by rallying your campus around the campaign for copyright reform.</p>

        <p>By doing so, we can shift this debate and harness this once in a generation moment to make a real difference by enacting progressive, modern reform of copyright law in the EU.</p>
