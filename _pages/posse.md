Mozilla is building an Open Source Student Club program dedicated to creating and supporting a network of clubs on university and college campuses around the world who are learning about and contributing to open source projects and open web technologies.

Our vision is to create a new generation of students who have a better understanding of open source, open practises and who are actively contributing.

We'd love your help in making this program a success and have put together some additional information below about the program and how to get involved.

### How can I support the program?

Help us find diverse student leaders who can help us build and shape the program for the US, read <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZOP4DNMIUrMxKMEZTdR3IgAP4eJKnAPZ5pcVkicwzU/pub">the description</a> and nominate a student, or pair of students, using the link below.

**The nomination form is now open: <a href="http://mzl.la/2oq69FW">mzl.la/2oq69FW</a>**

**This form will close at midnight (EST) on Friday, May 5th.**

Contribute to the creation of an intro to open source training. Email us at <campusclubs@mozilla.com>.

### What is the current state of the program?

In Spring 2017, we currently have <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/connect/">180 active Clubs</a>, primarily in asia, who are running a wide variety of activities related to the open web. However we currently have very few active clubs in the USA where we're looking to bring a focus on empowering and connecting existing open source clubs by providing training, content and connection opportunities.

### What's happening in the rest of 2017?

- **Spring** - Recruiting and selecting 20 Student Leaders who will help shape and launch the program in the US in September
- **Summer** - Training and working with our 20 Student Leaders to prepare for our September launch
- **Fall** - Initial Clubs launch in the US
- **Winter** - Invite more Clubs to join the program

### Why is Mozilla interested in open source on campuses?

<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">Mozilla's mission</a> is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent.

We believe that students are uniquely positioned to make a difference and that by bringing together and supporting local groups who care about open source and the open internet we can meaningfully advance this mission.

### Why should a club register with Mozilla?

By registering their Club with Mozilla, students will have access to:

1. **A Network** of mentors, professionals, and other student groups who share their passion for open.
2. **Activities & Challenges** designed to develop their skills and get students excited about contributing to open source projects and open web technologies.

### What kinds of Clubs can register with Mozilla?

Any existing open source or technology focused Club who are interested in contributing to open source projects can register with Mozilla.

Students who are interested in starting a new open source club can also register with us and we'll provide support for the set-up and initial launch.

### Do Clubs need to change their names or adopt the Mozilla branding in any way to register with Mozilla?

No - Clubs don't have to change their name/branding or adopt the Mozilla branding to be a registered club.

### When can US clubs start registering?

They can register on our <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/">website</a> at anytime, however we'll be launching the US version of the program in September with a new site. Existing student clubs can also support the program by trying out and providing feedback on our <a href="https://campus.mozilla.community/activities/">activities</a>.

### What about Canada?

While the primary focus of this launch will be the USA we're also inviting Canadian universities and students to participate in every stage of the process.
